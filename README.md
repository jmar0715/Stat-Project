# statproject

A Statistical Analysis Project by Jianna Martinez and James Hu that is meant to explore patterns of substance abuse to gather insight on how to minimize risk and harm as a result of drug abuse and addiction. Uses R as its programming language.

** Although completed for the purposes of assignment, both Jianna and James seek to continue the investigation; therefore, this project is by no means complete and finalized **
