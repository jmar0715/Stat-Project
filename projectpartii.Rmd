#2ND ANALYSIS

#for this next analysis, we will be utilizing more than one dataframe from part 1 of the first project, to investigate a potential relationship between OD death rates and income
#CHECK FOR ASSUMPTIONS

#least squares regression line plot
ggplot(data=incomeOD, aes(x = ODRate, y = MeanIncome)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method="lm")

#part of regression line eq
incomeod_model <- lm(MeanIncome ~ ODRate, data = incomeOD)

#normalized

#residual plot
plot(fitted(incomeod_model), residuals)

standard_residuals <- rstandard(incomeod_model)
print(standard_residuals)

#standardized residual plot
plot(fitted(incomeod_model), standard_residuals)
#since residual plot is random, this confirms that any error is only due to random error between both variables

#combine
income_rate <- incomeOD[c("ODRate", "MeanIncome")]
income_rate_stdres <- cbind(rate_income, standard_residuals)
print(income_rate_stdres)

#removing necessary s resid 
income_rate_analysis <- income_rate_stdres %>% filter(between(standard_residuals, -2, 2))
print(income_rate_analysis)

summary(lm(MeanIncome ~ ODRate, data = income_rate_analysis))

#since the absolute value of the correlation coefficient is close to 0, and on top of this, the regression line eq also contains a slope close to zero, we can conclude that there is a weak relationship between OD death rate and income. However, the fact that the correlation coefficient value is negative might be notable. From this, it is probable that there are many other variables at hand that make it difficult to see a strong relationship between both variables.

#next, since for part 1 of the project we also investigated suicide rates by state, it would be interesting to investigate this variable in relation to the two above in a multiple regression line analysis
